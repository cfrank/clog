Build steps

I recommend doing an "out of source build" so that CMake generated files don't
pollute the root directory. The following steps will assume that you are
following that.

mkdir build;cd build
cmake ../
sudo make install

The typical shared library files will be placed in their usual location, and can
be viewed in the generated build/install_manifest.json file
