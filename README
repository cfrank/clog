libclog

A Simple C loggging library. Tries not to do too much.

Build Requirements:
===================

CMake > 3.9
C99

Requirements
====================

C99 Standard Library

Install steps (recommended)
===========

The easiest way to use this is just to copy over the files and compile them
along side your project.

Library install steps
=====================

I recommend doing an "out of source build" so that CMake generated files don't
pollute the root directory. The following steps will assume that you are
following that.

    mkdir build;cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install

The typical shared library files will be placed in their usual location, and can
be viewed in the generated build/install_manifest.json file
